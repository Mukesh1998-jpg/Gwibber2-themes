Hi there, wish you a very Happy New year!
If you're a Gwibber 2 user, do try these themes I've been working on recently - 
	
	Gwibbles - shows messages as bubbles spread across whole page
	Gwibbly - a Tweetie like interface for gwibber

to install download these and drop in your -
	~/.local/share/gwibber/ui/themes/   folder. 

If that path does not exist, just do an mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gwibber/ui/themes/

Have fun :)
